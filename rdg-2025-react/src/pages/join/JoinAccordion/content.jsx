        We produce three main shows each year — in April, July and December —
        along with several one-act festival entries. Anyone is welcome to
        audition for these productions. Auditions are usually held around 12
        weeks before a show and include:
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Scripts available to read in advance</li>
          <li>Announced audition pieces</li>
          <li>A friendly, informal read-through</li>
          <li>Casting decisions made shortly afterwards and shared by email</li>
        </ul>
        We also encourage members aged 16+ to audition for our main shows, and
        our youth sections regularly take part in festivals and their own annual
        musical.

        If you prefer working behind the scenes, there’s plenty to get involved
        in:

            Set building (our Saturday sessions at the RDG Studio are famously
            social!)

          <li>Stage management</li>
          <li>Props and costumes</li>
          <li>Lighting and sound</li>
          <li>Front of house support during performances</li>
        </ul>

        learn.

        Not keen on performing or technical work? You can still play a vital
        role. Members help with:
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Publicity and marketing</li>
          <li>Programme selling</li>
          <li>Front-of-house welcome teams</li>
          <li>Supporting fundraising events</li>
        </ul>
        These roles are perfect for those who enjoy meeting people and
        supporting community theatre.
