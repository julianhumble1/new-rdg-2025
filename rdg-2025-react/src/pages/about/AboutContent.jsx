        Runnymede Drama Group (charity no. 292974) is run by volunteer committee
        members, elected each year at our AGM, and powered by a membership with
        a collective passion for theatre.
      </div>
      <div>
        Since 1948, we’ve been creating high-quality community theatre and now
        produce at least five shows each year, ranging from full-length plays to
        award-winning entries in local drama festivals.
      </div>
      <div>
        We are proud to welcome both performers and backstage volunteers.
        Whether you want to act, help build sets, join the technical team, or
        support behind the scenes, there is a place for you at RDG. Full
        membership is open to anyone 16+, and our youth group, The Sundowners,
        offers opportunities for younger performers too with their annual
        musical production.
