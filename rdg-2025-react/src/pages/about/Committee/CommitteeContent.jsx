        RDG is run by a dedicated committee of volunteers elected each year at
        our Annual General Meeting (AGM). The committee oversees productions,
        events, membership, finances and the general running of the group.

        Every summer, we hold an open meeting where members propose plays they
        would like to direct for the following year. After discussion, a
        balanced programme is selected and confirmed by the committee. Members
        can contribute ideas and help shape future seasons.
